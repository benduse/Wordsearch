					Unlike other languages that you already know, Kinyarwanda has only 23
					alphabets. The letters Q and X do not exist in the Kinyarwanda
					language. I will list them for the sake of showing you that they do
					not exist but keep in mind tha you will not encounter them in original
					Kinyarwanda words.
